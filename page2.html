        Fake, false, or regularly misleading websites that are shared on
        Facebook and social media. Some of these websites may rely on “outrage”
        by using distorted headlines and decontextualized or dubious information
        in order to generate likes, shares, and profits. Fake websites have
        become increasingly pervasive, generating billions of dollars in
        fraudulent revenue at the expense of unsuspecting Internet users. The
        design and appearance of these websites makes it difficult for users to
        manually identify them as fake. To overcome this problem we introduce
        “Just For You” which connect you to the real websites of different
        different departments of government and many other private websites. It
        provides you right and secure path to the websites where you can share
        your information and data without any hesitation. In this website in
        beginning stage we introduce three platforms such as section 1.
        Government Documents, section 2. Booking Section, section 3. Food &
        Groceries.
